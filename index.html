## 📄 Privacy Policy for GPT Middleware

**Last updated:** July 20, 2025

### 1. Introduction

GPT Middleware (“we,” “us,” “our”) is a conversational assistant that interacts with your memory API to retrieve, summarize, compare, and store notes. This privacy policy explains what data we collect, how we use your data, and your privacy rights.

---

### 2. Information We Collect

* **User Input:** Any text you enter during chats, such as note titles, queries, IDs, or content.
* **System Metadata:** Chat metadata such as timestamps and message identifiers.
* **API Interaction Data:** The note content, summaries, and comparisons retrieved via the memory API.

As noted in the OpenAI policy, our use of the GPT API is only to process your inputs and memory data—no training data or fueling of OpenAI models is included. ([Termly][1])

---

### 3. How We Use Your Data

* **Service Execution:** To call and present results from your memory API.
* **Functionality:** To summarize, compare, and manage notes per your instructions.
* **Diagnostics:** Temporarily to debug or improve service performance.

We do *not* store your data externally or share it with third parties.

---

### 4. Data Retention

We retain data only for the duration of your active session. No notes or chat logs are stored beyond what your memory API persistently maintains.

---

### 5. Third-Party Services

We use the OpenAI API securely and in compliance with data protection standards. You can view OpenAI’s privacy practices on their website. ([OpenAI][2])

---

### 6. Security

We apply standard security measures and HTTPS encryption (via ngrok endpoint) to protect your data during transit.

---

### 7. Your Privacy Rights

* You have the right to request deletion of any saved note via your memory API.
* You may discontinue using the GPT or disable chat history in OpenAI (see their policy).

---

### 8. Children

Our service is **not intended for children under 13**.

---

### 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy occasionally. We'll update the “Last updated” date, and users can review any changes here.

---

### 10. Contact Us

For inquiries or concerns, please contact us at [your-preferred-email@example.com](mailto:your-preferred-email@example.com).

---

### ✅ Summary of Key Compliance

* Clearly states what data is collected and why. ([Reddit][3], [TermsFeed][4])
* References OpenAI’s privacy practices and GPT API usage. ([Simpliant][5])
* States data retention policies and user control. ([Simpliant][5])
* Easy-to-understand, avoids legal jargon. ([iubenda][6])

🔧 **Next steps:**

1. Save this as `privacy.html` or `.md` in your project/repo.
2. Publish it (e.g., GitHub Pages or personal domain).
3. Copy the HTTPS URL into your GPT’s “Privacy policy URL” field and save the GPT config.
